This is the Auto Case app. The basics of this app are to change the casing of text you input in it.
There are currently 4 options: Uppercase everything, lowercase everything, alternate the casing for
every letter, and the random casing for randomly capitalized and lowercase letters. It also stores
your history so you can see all the text you have inputted in the app. This app was made with
Android Studio.
